Invacare Corp said the Canadian Federal Court ruled in favor of it in a patent infringement action filed against Everest and Jennings Canadian Ltd. The court ordered that Everest respond in an undisclosed amount of damages to Invacare for its actions. A corresponding case is currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

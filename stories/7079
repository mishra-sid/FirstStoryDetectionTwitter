Treasury Secretary James Baker said he opposes a new tax on securities transactions. "No," he said when asked by a reporter whether he favored such a tax, which has been advocated by House Speaker James Wright (D-Tex). He added, "Not unless you want to tax a whole bunch of little security holders, which is not a good idea."

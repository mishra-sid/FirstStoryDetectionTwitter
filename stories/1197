Carling O'Keefe Ltd said the board decided to retain ownership of its Toronto Argonaut Football Club, after considering offers to acquire the team. The company said it received a number of expressions of interest in buying the club, of which two became formal offers to purchase. Neither offer met the company's unspecified requirements for selling the football club, Carling said. The Toronto Argonauts are a member of the Canadian Football League.

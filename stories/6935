An official proposal that Finland scrap price controls and replace them with a system aimed at promoting competition is expected to go to parliament later this year, officials said.

It proposes that a new board be set up to ensure large firms do not abuse their market positions and that monopolies do not expand beyond their approved sectors. REUTER &#3;

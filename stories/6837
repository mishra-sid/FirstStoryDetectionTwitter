The Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing an investigation of the practice of "parking" stocks, said Richard Murphy, a lawyer with the SEC enforcement division. Earlier, the SEC settled civil charges against Boyd Jefferies and Jefferies Group Inc, which allege market manipulation and the parking of stocks, a practice where stock is held by one person or firm while it is actually under the control of someone else. Murphy told reporters others are being investigated for parking stocks.

Tri-Star Pictures Inc said it is changing its fiscal year to year ending at the end of February from a calendar year to reflect the traditional business cycles of its two principal businesses, motion picture distribution and motion picture exhibition. It said it expects to file a report for the two-month fiscal "year" ended February 28, 1987 by May 28 and to report earnings for the new first quarter in June.

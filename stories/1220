Legislation to implement the first stage of a promised sweeping new regulatory framework for the Canadian banking system was presented in the House of Commons, the finance department said. The department said the main measures in the bill include the previously announced consolidation of federal supervisory agencies into the new Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and a strengthening of the Canada Deposit Insurance Act. The department said further legislation, first outlined in the December policy statement will be introduced later this year and will include broadening of the powers of financial institutions and the new ownership policies.

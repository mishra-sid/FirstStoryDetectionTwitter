Bell Petroleum Services Inc, currently in Chapter 11, said Regal International Inc has acquired an option to buy its secured notes held by its banks. Bell said Regal also expressed interest in discussing an acquisition offer, but Bell's board rejected the offer, saying it wanted to remain independent and proceed with its chapter 11 reorganization. The company said that its ability to reorganize will be hampered because a major competitor now holds an option on its notes.

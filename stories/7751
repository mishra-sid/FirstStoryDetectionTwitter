Dominion Resources Inc said it will establish a joint venture with CSX Corp's CSX Transportation Inc to develop electric power cogeneration projects. The new venture, to be called Energy Dominion, is being set up to consider, evaluate and possibly carry out one or more cogeneration projects outside Dominion's subsidiary, Virginia Power's, service area, Dominion said. Energy Dominion will consider specific projects on a case by case basis, concentrating on coal- and gas-fired cogeneration opportunities in the northeastern U.S., it said.

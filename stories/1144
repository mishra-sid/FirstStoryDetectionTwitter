FBI Director William Webster refused all comment on whether he has been approached to head the Central Intelligence Agency. After testifying before a Senate Judiciary Committee, Webster answered repeatedly with "no comment" when asked by reporters if he has been approached. Webster has been mentioned as a possible top choice to head the spy agency following President Reagan's forced withdrawal of the nomination of acting director Robert Gates, to succeed ailing ex-CIA chief William Casey.

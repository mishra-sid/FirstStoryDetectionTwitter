Confessed spy Jonathan Pollard was sentenced today to life in prison for passing thousands of pages of top-secret U.S. military documents to Israel. Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst, was sentenced for his role in what prosecutors described as one of the most serious breaches of security in U.S. history. Pollard, a 32-year-old American Jew, claimed he was acting out of concern for Israel's safety and the belief that U.S. officials were withholding intelligence from Israel.

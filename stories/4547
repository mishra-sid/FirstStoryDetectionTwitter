ALC Communications Corp said it urged the U.S. District Court in Washington not to allow the regional Bell companies to offer long distance telephone services. ALC, parent of Allnet Communications Services, a long distance carrier, said it made the request in comments filed with the court on a Department of Justice proposal to free the regional Bell companies from various business restrictions. Under terms of the divestiture of American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T>, the Bell companies are prohibited from providing long distance services.

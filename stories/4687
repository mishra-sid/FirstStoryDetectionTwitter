MCI Communications Corp said it opposed recent recommendations by the U.S. Justice Department that would loosen restrictions on the regional bell operating companies. MCI said the restrictions on the regional bell companies should only be loosened if their monopolies on local service are eliminated. It said the proposals to loosen those restrictions are at odds with the rulings that governed the break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> in 1984.

President Aquino has ordered the dissolution of all armed civilian vigilante groups around the Philippines, officials said. The order follows protests about the activities of vigilantes by human-rights activists, but goes against calls by the military for more such groups. The vigilantes have been credited with a major role in recent successes in several districts against communist rebels.

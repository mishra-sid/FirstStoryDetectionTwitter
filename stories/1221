American Telephone and Telegraph Co said it will offer a special team of representatives to help hearing-impaired persons use telecommunications services. The team will work through the company's National Special Needs Center, which offers various products that enable hearing-, motion-, speech- and vision-impaired persons to use telecommunications devices such as a keyboard to talk and paper or video printouts to listen.

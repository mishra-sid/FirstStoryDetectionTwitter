Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle is preparing to announce his resignation from the Pentagon, possibly as early as today, Pentagon officials said. The officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters that Perle was expected to quit in order to become a private defense consultant. Perle, a staunch critic of U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements and an influential spokesman for anti-Soviet hardliners in and out of the Reagan Administration, has served as assistant defense secretary for international security policy since 1981.

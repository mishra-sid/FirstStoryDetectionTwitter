Holiday Corp said its Holiday Inn Hotel Group will soon introduce a chain of limited-service hotels in international markets. The company said the chain, which will be launched initially in Western Europe, will usually feature 60 to 150 guest rooms and a small restuarant/lounge area, but will offer fewer services and amenities than typical Holiday Inn hotels. It said the new hotels will cater to commercial travelers in smaller cities and suburbs.

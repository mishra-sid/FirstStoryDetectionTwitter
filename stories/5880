An on-off parliamentary boycott has forced Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to adopt a provisional budget, government officials said. Economic analysts saw this as another setback in Nakasone's plans to overhaul the Japanese tax system. The parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over Nakasone's plans for a five per cent sales tax has made it impossible for the full 1987-88 budget to be passed by the start of the fiscal year on April 1, government officials said.

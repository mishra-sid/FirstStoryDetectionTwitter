Sun Microsystems Inc said it has agreed to cooperate with Philips Corporate Group Home Interactive Systems, a Dutch electronics firm, to develop a multi-media authoring computer system. The system will be based upon the integration of Sun workstation and Compact Disc Interactive technologies, the company said. The authoring systems are collections of hardware, system utilities and software to enable Comact Disc Interactive application developers to design, assemble and test interactive, multi-media applications in entertainment, education and information for consumer and institutions.
